# Our Process

<br/>

### Let's Meet

Let us catch up over a coffee or skype and discuss about your vision and the problem you want to solve.

### Storyboarding

Post meeting, form user stories that clearly define the scope of the project. We put your requirements down on a project management tool like trello in the form of user stories. This clearly defines the scope of projects and ensure both parties know what we are getting into.

### Sprints

We break our product development cycle into many sprints that are about 2 weeks each. Each sprint has a monday morning sprint planning meeting and daily ten minute stand ups. At the second friday we have a sprint conclusion demo and a retrospective.

### Feedback

We set up a staging server where our continuous delivery manager will automatically deploy the latest code we push. You can check the status of your project anytime on our staging server and provide us feedback.

### Acceptance

Once we deliver a user story, you can test it out on staging server and accept the story or give us feedback if any.

### Completion

Once all the stories have been accepted by you, we prepare the project for delivery and give you a documentation of our work.
